F0309 02:18:30.808624 30268 accuracy_layer.cpp:31] Check failed: outer_num_ * inner_num_ == bottom[1]->count() (80 vs. 10) Number of labels must match number of predictions; e.g., if label axis == 1 and prediction shape is (N, C, H, W), label count (number of labels) must be N*H*W, with integer values in {0, 1, ..., C-1}.
